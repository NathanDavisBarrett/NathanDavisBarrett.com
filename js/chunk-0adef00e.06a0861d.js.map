Similarly, I beleive that happiness is found in living a good, honest, diligent, involved, and aware life.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"philPoint\">\r\n                <h3>Kindness and Respect</h3>\r\n                <p><b>The happiest way to live life is to be kind to yourself and others.</b> Many of the hardest parts of life can be made better simply by being kind. I try to conciously realize that virtually all people are doing their best. Getting worked up when things don't go as you'd like almost never makes the situation better. The best way to handle the highs and the lows in life are to be respectful and kind.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"philPoint\">\r\n                <h3>Reasonability</h3>\r\n                <p>When decision making, everyone should <b>take a moment to think, consider various aspects of a situation, ask for valuable advice, and reflect</b>. Rushed, thoughtless, or careless decisions often lead to regrets and mistakes. Aspects such as logical reasonablness, emotional awareness of yourself and others, external factors, and eventual outcomes should all be considered.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"philPoint\">\r\n                <h3>Appropriate Confidence, and Humility</h3>\r\n                <p>I beleive <b>experts should be experts</b>, and we should let them be. When you are the expert, and you have reason to be confident, you should not be afraid to assert it. However, there are many instances where overconfidence has lead to misinformation, accidents, and heartache. When appropriate, we should not be ashamed or too arragant to receive help and input from others.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"philPoint\">\r\n                <h3>Hard Work and Not Being Complacent</h3>\r\n                <p>With nearly all things in life, <b>the greater the reward, the higher the price to get it</b>.
